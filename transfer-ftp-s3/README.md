# LocalStack Demo: FTP Upload to S3 Bucket via AWS Transfer API

Simple demo application illustrating the use of AWS Transfer API in LocalStack.

## Prerequisites

* LocalStack
* Docker
* `make`

## Installing

To install the dependencies:
```
make install
```

## Running

Make sure that LocalStack is started:
```
LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=... DEBUG=1 localstack start
```

The following command runs the test application locally, creates an FTP server via AWS Transfer API locally, uploads two files via FTP, and downloads the files from the target S3 bucket:
```
make run
```

You should then see a couple of log messages in the terminal:
```
