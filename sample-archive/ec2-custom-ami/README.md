# LocalStack Demo: EC2 VMs and Custom Images using Packer

Simple demo application illustrating EC2 virtual machines (VMs) and building images locally, using LocalStack.

## Prerequisites

* LocalStack
* Docker
* `make`
* [`awslocal`](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local)
* [`packer`](https://www.packer.io)
* `VirtualBox` on Mac OS

**Note:** This demo currently only works using VirtualBox on Mac OS. Support for additional operating systems and hypervisors will be added soon.

Note: This demo may require downloading a few large files (e.g., virtual machine base image) - please ensure that you're on a fast and stable internet connection.

## Installing

To install the dependencies:
```
make install
```

## App Details

Please refer to the `containers.json` and `packer.json` configuration files.

## Running

Make sure that LocalStack is started with the following `SERVICES` configuration:
```
LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=... DEBUG=1 SERVICES=cloudformation,ec2 localstack start
```

Run the application and trigger the virtual machine build process:
```
make run
```

You should see a temporary virtual machine getting started in VirtualBox, which then gets configured using the initialization script `setup.sh`. .

As the script is running, you should see some logs and a success output in the terminal:
```

The test SSH keys are included in this repository. To manually ssh into the instance, you can use this command (please note that the IP `127.0.100.2` is extracted from the output above):
```
$ ssh -i localstack.id_rsa ec2-user@127.0.100.2
