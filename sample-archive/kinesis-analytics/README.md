# LocalStack Demo: Continuous SQL Queries using Kinesis Data Analytics

Simple demo application using Kinesis Data Analytics to run continuous SQL queries over Kinesis data streams in LocalStack.

## Prerequisites

* LocalStack
* Docker
* `make`

## Installing

To install the dependencies:
```
make install
```

## Running

Make sure that LocalStack is started with the following `SERVICES` configuration:
```
LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=... DEBUG=1 SERVICES=cloudformation,kinesisanalytics,kinesis localstack start
```

Deploy the app locally and run a Lambda test invocation:
```
make run
```

The application first creates a Kinesis Data Analytics application, defined as a CloudFormation template. The core part of the application is the following SQL query, which continuously queries events from a Kinesis stream (input stream `input1_001`) and puts the reults on an output stream:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM input1_001 (
    symbol VARCHAR(20), price float, volume LONG)
DESCRIPTION 'Test description 123';
SELECT STREAM * FROM input1_001 WHERE volume < 150;
```

Once the application is deployed, the script adds a record to the input Kinesis stream and starts listening on the output Kinesis stream.

You should see a sequence of successful API calls in the output, similar to the logs below:
```

}
