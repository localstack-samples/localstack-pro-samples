# LocalStack Demo: Manage Files in a CodeCommit Git Repository

Simple demo application illustrating the use of the AWS CodeCommit API in LocalStack.

## Prerequisites

* LocalStack
* Docker
* `make`

## Installing

To install the dependencies:
```
make install
```

## Running

Make sure that LocalStack is started:
```
LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=... DEBUG=1 localstack start
```

The following command runs the test application locally, creates an Git repository via the AWS CodeCommit API locally, commits and pushes a test file to the repository, and then checks out the file in a fresh clone of the repository:
```
make run
```

You should then see a couple of log messages in the terminal:
```
$ make run
