# LocalStack Pro Samples

This repository contains sample projects that can be deployed on your local machine using [LocalStack Pro](https://localstack.cloud/).

Each example in the repository is prefixed with the name of the AWS service being used. For example, the `elb-load-balancing` directory contains examples that demonstrate how to use the Elastic Load Balancing service with LocalStack. Please refer to the sub directories for more details and instructions on how to start the samples.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [`awslocal` CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/)
* [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started)
* [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
* `make` & `jq`

## Configuration

Some of the samples require LocalStack Pro features. Please make sure to properly configure the `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` environment variable. You can find your API key in the [LocalStack Pro dashboard](https://app.localstack.cloud/account/apikeys) and you can refer to our [API key documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/api-key/) for more details.

## Checking out a single sample

To check out a single sample, you can use the following commands:

```bash
mkdir localstack-samples && cd localstack-samples
git init
git remote add origin -f git@github.com:localstack/localstack-pro-samples.git
git config core.sparseCheckout true
echo <LOCALSTACK_SAMPLE_DIRECTORY_NAME> >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin master
```

The above commands use `sparse-checkout` to only pull the sample you are interested in. You can find the name of the sample directory in the table above.
