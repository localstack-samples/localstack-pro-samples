# LocalStack Demo: Athena Queries over S3 Files

Simple demo application illustrating how to run Athena queries over S3 files locally, using LocalStack.

## Prerequisites

* LocalStack
* Docker
* Node.js / `npm`
* `make`

## Installing

To install the dependencies:
```
make install
```

## Starting LocalStack

Make sure that LocalStack is started:
```
LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=... DEBUG=1 localstack start
```

## Running

Start the app locally and run the Athena test queries:
```
make run
```

The demo script performs the following actions:

1. Create an S3 bucket and upload test data (CSV files with person details) to the bucket
2. Run queries to create the table metadata in Athena
3. Running a simple query over the test file - querying the number of users by gender (male/female)
4. Downloading the query results from the S3 results bucket

You should see something similar to the following log output in the terminal:
```
$ ./run.sh
Uploading test data to S3...
make_bucket: athena-test
upload: data/data.csv to s3://athena-test/data/data.csv
